# Arc01 — Format and runtime evidence

## Capability and status

Deliver a reproducible account of what native Deno and candidate packages
provide for JSON and YAML, what they lose, and what Lykn libraries must add.
Evidence includes package provenance and the actual runtime/toolchain
baseline, so a dependency recommendation is not inferred from a registry name.

Active arc. Slice01 is CDC closed. Slice02 is CC proposed-done: all 17 JSON
families executed after launcher, package and supervisor preflights. Its
independent CDC reproduction is next; no formal Slice02 closure is claimed.
See the [project plan](../project-plan.md) and [arc ledger](ledger.md).

## Slice breakdown

| Slice | Scope and output | Dependency | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [slice01-baseline-and-protocol](slice01-baseline-and-protocol/slice-plan.md) | Pin toolchain/source/package identities, reconcile the exploratory claims, and specify a reproducible research protocol and fixture matrix | None | CDC closed; seven criteria reproduced |
| [slice02-json-behavior](slice02-json-behavior/slice-plan.md) | Exercise JSON read/parse/edit/write through Lykn; document precision, duplicates, absent/null, errors, ordering, escaping, unsupported values, JSONC, framed streams, and file-failure behavior | Slice01; verified Arc03/Slice01 launcher correction | CC proposed-done; 161 variants/354 attempts; CDC pending |
| slice03-yaml-fidelity | Exercise YAML value and document workflows through Lykn; compare schemas, aliases/cycles, non-string keys, multi-document support, diagnostics, comments/layout, and candidate preservation APIs | Slice01; reuse Slice02 harness observations | Planned; open set deferred |
| slice04-dependency-and-runtime-boundary | Reconcile runtime/package graphs and provenance, Node/npm exclusion, exact versions and lock integrity, permissions, offline replay, resource constraints, and adoption alternatives | Slices01–03 evidence | Planned; open set deferred |

Each execution slice must remain small enough for one context plus correction
headroom. If the JSON or YAML matrix proves too large, explicitly split that
slice before execution and preserve every case in the arc plan and ledger.
Source/native-format fidelity and application validation are separate axes.

## Decisions this arc informs

- Is native JSON adequate for the required numeric and duplicate-key policy?
- Which JSON extensions are useful without implying preservation guarantees?
- Does the first YAML use case need value rewriting, document preservation,
  or both, and what evidence supports the fidelity promised by each candidate?
- Which YAML schemas and value kinds can a library accept without silent loss?
- Which implementation, package source, dependency graph, and permission model
  satisfy the operator's no-Node/no-npm-ecosystem direction?
- What must the later Lykn ADT and authoring trials exercise?

The operator's direction excludes Node/npm ecosystem dependence for the new
libraries. Research must expose existing exceptions and candidate provenance,
not silently allow npm because older guides permit it. Code ancestry, registry,
transitive dependencies, and required runtime are separate facts. Whether an
independently maintained port's ancestry is acceptable remains a decision to
document, not an automatic rejection or acceptance.

## Verification and artifacts

Each slice owns its `artifacts/` directory, reproducible instructions, raw
observations, and evidence-strength statements. Successful ordinary cases
must be accompanied by malformed, boundary, and unsupported cases. Keep
input bytes and output bytes when assessing fidelity; data equality alone
cannot demonstrate document preservation. Test file failure behavior only in
isolated fixtures; never edit real configuration or user documents as probes.

Slice01 defines execution locations and allowed source scope for later
prompts. This arc does not make blanket source changes or adopt packages into
the language repository. It does authorize narrow, inspectable research
fixtures through the slice plans. Corrections discovered here feed Arc03;
blocking corrections may require opening that work earlier.

At arc close, independently replay a JSON and YAML workflow from the recorded
baseline and reconcile the result with the overall capability/dependency
matrix. Check that every policy question has evidence or a specific unresolved
decision, and that all authoring findings have survived into the next arc.

## Expedited Mode

Slice01 [closing report](slice01-baseline-and-protocol/closing-report.md) and
[findings](slice01-baseline-and-protocol/artifacts/findings.md) establish new
prerequisites for the next opening: D-2609-PERM required correction before
runtime launches; historical source inserted `-A`. That correction is now
CDC closed. Keep JSON first and retain every FM01 case.
D-2609-YNOD gates execution/adoption of @eemeli/yaml 2.9.1 because published
source imports Node APIs; Slice03's document workflow remains required.
[Arc03/Slice01](../arc03-findings-and-integration/slice01-run-permissions/slice-plan.md)
is now CDC closed; [verification](../arc03-findings-and-integration/slice01-run-permissions/cdc-verification.md)
reproduces the correction and build receipt. Slice02 records the verified pins
and launch contract; its own preflights still require evidence.
Guide/book findings D-2609-LINT/NPMB/JSER and the source/binary provenance gap
must survive the later authoring/integration openings. This records a dependency,
not a source-scope expansion or acceptance decision.

Apply the project's exact-path commits, proposed-done/CDC separation, immediate
evidence-based close and next-slice opening, and arc composition rules.
Slice02 now has a [CC evidence handoff](slice02-json-behavior/closing-report.md).
CDC must independently verify it before opening Slice03. The existing JSON
cc-prompt remains the replay/scope contract.
Do not generate a close set or mark research complete merely because the
planning documents exist.

## Slice02 evidence carried forward

[Results](slice02-json-behavior/artifacts/results.md) distinguish native precision,
duplicate, unsupported-value and lexical losses; JSONC comments; framed streams;
canonical ordering; and file/resource boundaries. All 17 families remain covered,
with no requested deferral. Source-aware reviver/rawJSON availability is pinned
runtime evidence, not a dependency or architecture decision.

D-2609-NZRO/JSCF/UNUS add sign-sensitive code generation, invalid emitted control
forms and misleading unused-binding diagnostics to Arc02 observation and proposed
Arc03 correction work. Their detailed source is retained in the
[authoring record](slice02-json-behavior/artifacts/authoring-observations.md).
Future YAML authoring must verify generated output before interpreting format
results and preserve correction headroom; do not assume that check/compile exit0
means runnable code. Existing D-2609-JSER receives BigInt runtime evidence.

Slice04 still owns full graph/provenance policy, cold offline conditions,
concurrent replacement/durability, and resource contract limits. Arc02 still
owns ADT/Result/Option/module/formatter and actual operator code-shape review.
J-15's known-frame decoder is not a complete text-sequence validator. No source
correction is authorized by this research handoff.

## Version History

- 2026-09-12 v1.4: Slice02 delivered CC-attested JSON evidence for every family;
  retained three compiler findings and explicit resource/framing boundaries.
  Added generated-output verification to later authoring preparation because
  successful compilation alone did not establish valid JavaScript. CDC and
  later slice openings remain separate; no YAML/runtime obligations dropped.

- 2026-09-12 v1.3: Arc03/Slice01 CDC reproduced the launcher correction;
  resumed JSON Slice02 with verified build/runtime pins. All JSON families
  and package/resource controls remain in scope; no format result is claimed.
- 2026-09-12 v1.2: Independently verified and closed Slice01; opened Slice02
  with all JSON families retained and execution blocked on the newly opened
  Arc03/Slice01 launcher correction. Historical baseline drift remains explicit.
- 2026-09-12 v1.1: Slice01 supplied attested baseline/protocol and exposed
  launcher/candidate prerequisites; updated status and explicit bubble-ups
  without removing, closing, or opening later work.
- 2026-09-12 v1.0: Opened the format/runtime evidence arc with four bounded
  research slices; detailed the baseline-and-protocol slice first. Preserved
  YAML and dependency-provenance research alongside the JSON starting point.
